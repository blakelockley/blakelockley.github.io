    "description": "During my time at Macquarie University I participated in the PACE (Professional and Community Engagement) program sponsored by EY Data &amp; Analytics. Our task involved working as a small team to develop a Machine Learning solution to assist recruitment staff in finding the best candidates possible. My role on the team was Lead Developer. I'm proud of the solution we arrived at over the 15-week program and this resulted in me receiving an offer to join the company as a Graduate Consultant. I've now become a PACE sponsor where I work closely to mentor and guide students while they complete the program as I did. Since my time at EY I have had the opportunity to work on a range of interesting and challenging projects at two reputable Australian companies. <br><br> <strong><u>Genesis Care (Present)</u></strong><br><b> Backend Developer (Python)</b><br> My current project entails developing a customer-facing web app. My role on the project is as a Backend Developer working closely with the integration team to build the Django and API layers of the app. Being part of a project that will make a real difference to people in need was a massive motivation in why I chose to take on this opportunity. <br><br><strong><u>Insurance Group Australia (IAG)</u></strong><br><b>CI/CD + SQL Developer</b><br> My first engagement with EY was at IAG as part of the Release Management team. My role entailed developing automation scripts and CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Python. After the completion of the Release Management project I moved into a SQL Developer role working with the data warehouse within the customer labs for one of IAG's brands. I have also contributed in multiple other streams for the IAG account.",
