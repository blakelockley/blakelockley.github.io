    "description": "Working in the iOS team at AIM, I’ve primarily worked on radio streaming iPhone apps, building and maintaining these for a range of Australian broadcasting companies. Apps I’ve worked on primarily revolve around streaming audio which allows users to download and listen to podcasts. The role ranges from building interfaces, implementing the on boarding process to retrieving data from multiple provided APIs. At AIM I've worked on a range of streaming apps for major clients in Australian broadcasting such as the ABC, Southern Cross Austereo and Nova. I have added features in major releases to apps such as ABC Listen, Nova 969, Hit FM, Triple M, and various others. I was given the role of primary developer building the ABC Kids Listen app from start to the first major release, while still providing maintenance and updates to the application. This app was the first app in the company developed in Swift while still leveraging off the company's established reactive framework. ABC Kids Listen is available to download on the App Store.",
