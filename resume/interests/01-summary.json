    "description": "Outside of work I play weekly social basketball with a small group of friends. On the weekends I try to spend as much time as possible <b>outdoors</b> unwinding <b>with friends</b>. But when indoors I enjoy reading <b>technical books</b> on programming and science and a working on my own side projects.<br/><br/>My original interest in software was in <b>games programming</b> which has led to me enjoying <b>low-level programming</b>, <b>graphics programing</b> and overall game design. From my recent experience in machine learning and artificial intelligence Iâ€™ve developed an interest in <b>generative neural networks</b>, an area in which I hope to focus some time on later in my career."
